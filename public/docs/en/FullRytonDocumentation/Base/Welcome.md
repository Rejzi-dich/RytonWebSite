# Hello! I am the creator of Ryton

You know, when I started programming, I was told that it was "not for me." Math was hard at school, and the teachers kept twirling their fingers at my temple when I said I wanted to create games.

But I didn't listen to them. And you did the right thing!

Because programming is not about "innate talent" or mathematics. It's about perseverance and interest. About the desire to create cool things!

And that's why I created Ryton. A language in which everything is simple and understandable. Where you can immediately start making games and programs. Without abstruse terms and fear of making mistakes.

So if they tell you "it's not for you" or "you can't do it," don't listen to them and keep learning. To spite all the skeptics, become a cool developer!

And Ryton and I will help you with this.

## Everyone started small:
### Linus Torvalds
The first program: a simple calculator in Basic at the age of 11
Now: The creator of Linux and Git

### Bill Gates
The first program: tic-tac-toe in Basic at the age of 13
Now: Microsoft Founder

### Rejzi (creator of Ryton)
The first program: The program "pseudo-friend" in Python at the age of 13
Currently: Developer of the Ryton programming language

Here is my first Python code (2017):
```python
while True:
    text = input("how are you? \n >")
    print("this ", text)
```

Each developer started with simple programs. The main thing is not to stop!

## Where should I start?
- Install Ryton
- Read the basic lessons
- Create your first program
- Share your successes in the community

Remember - every great developer once wrote his first "Hello World"!
